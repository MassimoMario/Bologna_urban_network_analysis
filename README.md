# Bologna Complex Network Analysis
Implementation of a Bologna urban street network analysis using complex network algorithms, with the comparison of traffic and accident data from _Comune di Bologna_ with a simulation.

All the computation are presented as a jupyter notebook written in python.

# Requirements
* Standard python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, tqdm)
* Networkx
* [OSMnx](https://geoffboeing.com/publications/osmnx-complex-street-networks/)

# Use
The code will show a quantitative analysis of Bologna urban street network properties followed by a comparison between a traffic simulation and real traffic data. bla bla bla
